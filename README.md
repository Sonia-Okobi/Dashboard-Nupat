## About The App

Dashboard-Nupat is a single page application developed with React

Project is created with the following:

- React
- SCSS
- Typescript

## Setup/Installation

To run this project, install it locally using yarn:

- Download or clone the repository
- Run yarn install
- Run yarn dev

## Approach

I created the application using vite as it provides a fast and lightweight development server that enables you to see changes in real-time as you write code. I chose to use Typescript as it enabled me to evade errors and to make my rewrites more easier. I used SCSS to make my stylesheet more structured and maintainable where I created variables and variants to reduce repititions in my code. I also used Flexbox and Grid which allowed me to create responsive layout for the application. I took into consideration coercion and separation of concerns while architecting my project folder. I created common components which I used as basic building blocks for my application.

## Difficulties

The challenge I ran into was trying to get my fonts to work.
